This (or some variation thereof) may work on Mac or Windows, but has not been tested.

Run the following commands to clone the repo into ~/fhdhr/fHDHR cd ~/fhdhr git clone https://github.com/fHDHR/fHDHR.git Create your config.ini file (as described earlier in this guide) in the ~/fhdhr/fHDHR directory.
